## 🧪 Using Practice Files

This repository includes two files designed for hands-on practice with GitHub Desktop:

### 📄 `Day.txt`
A Python script that prints the current day and date.

#### How to Use:
1. Open `Day.txt` in your code editor.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python Day.txt
   ```
3. Modify the script:
   - Change the output format.
   - Add comments or new lines.
   - Practice making commits after each change.

#### Example Edits:
- Add a new print statement.
- Change the date format using `strftime`.

---

### 📝 `test_Day.txt`
An empty file for experimentation.

#### How to Use:
- Add any content you like: text, code snippets, notes.
- Use it to practice:
  - Staging changes
  - Writing commit messages
  - Undoing changes
  - Creating branches
