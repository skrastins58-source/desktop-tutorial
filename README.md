# Desktop Tutorial

## 🧪 Practice File Overview
Expand the section to include:
- Purpose of each file (e.g., `Day.txt` for Python scripting, `test_Day.txt` for freeform experimentation)
- Suggested edits and commit exercises
- Link to new practice files like `Branching.txt`, `MergeConflict.txt`, and `CommitHistory.md` once they’re added

## 📝 Issue Templates
Use these to log your progress or report issues:

- [Practice Task](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/practice-task.yml)
- [Suggestion](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/suggestion.yml)
- [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml)

## 💡 Try This

- Create a new branch and commit a change to `Day.txt`
- Simulate a merge conflict using `MergeConflict.txt`
- Submit a suggestion using the issue template
- Track your commit history in `CommitHistory.md`
