## Creating Commits

A commit is like a snapshot of your changes. Here's how to create one:

1. **Review your changes** in GitHub Desktop:
   - Changed files appear in the left sidebar
   - Click on a file to see the specific changes (additions in green, deletions in red)

2. **Write a commit message:**
   - In the bottom-left corner, enter a brief, descriptive title
   - Example: "Add my name to README"
   - Optionally, add a longer description below

3. **Create the commit:**
   - Click "Commit to main" (or your current branch name)

*üì∑ Screenshot placeholder: Commit creation interface*

**üí° Tip:** Good commit messages are short but descriptive. They should complete this sentence: "If applied, this commit will..."

## Pushing Changes

After committing, your changes are saved locally but not yet on GitHub. To share them:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Look for "Push origin" button in the top toolbar
   - Click it to upload your commits to GitHub
   - Wait for the upload to complete

2. **Verify on GitHub.com:**
   - Visit this repository on GitHub.com
   - You should see your recent commit and changes

## Working with Branches

Branches let you work on different features without affecting the main code:

### Creating a New Branch

1. **Create a branch:**
   - Click the current branch name (usually "main") at the top
   - Click "New branch"
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "add-my-changes")
   - Click "Create branch"

*üì∑ Screenshot placeholder: Branch creation dialog*

### Making Changes on Your Branch

1. **Make some changes** to any file in the repository
2. **Commit the changes** (same process as before)
3. **Push the branch:**
   - Click "Publish branch" to share it on GitHub

### Switching Between Branches

1. **Switch branches:**
   - Click the current branch name
   - Select the branch you want to switch to
   - Your files will update to match that branch's state

## Creating Pull Requests

Pull requests let you propose changes to the main branch:

1. **From GitHub Desktop:**
   - After pushing your branch, click "Create Pull Request"
   - GitHub.com will open in your browser

2. **Fill out the pull request:**
   - Add a descriptive title
   - Explain what changes you made and why
   - Click "Create pull request"

3. **Review and merge:**
   - Others can review your changes
   - Once approved, the changes can be merged into main

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- ‚úÖ "Fix login button alignment"
- ‚úÖ "Add user authentication feature"
- ‚ùå "Fixed stuff"
- ‚ùå "Changes"

### Branching
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-login`, `fix/header-bug`
- Keep branches focused on one feature or fix
- Delete branches after they're merged

### Before Committing
- Review all your changes in GitHub Desktop
- Test your changes to make sure they work
- Only commit related changes together

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Repository not found" error:**
- Check that you have access to the repository
- Verify the repository URL is correct
- Make sure you're signed in to the right GitHub account

**Changes not showing up:**
- Make sure you saved all your files
- Check that you're looking at the correct branch
- Try refreshing GitHub Desktop (View ‚Üí Refresh)

**Push failed:**
- Pull the latest changes first (Repository ‚Üí Pull)
- Resolve any conflicts if they appear
- Try pushing again

**Can't switch branches:**
- Commit or discard your current changes first
- Check if there are conflicts preventing the switch
