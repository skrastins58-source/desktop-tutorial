## 🧪 Practice File Overview
Expand the section to include:
- Purpose of each file (e.g., `Day.txt` for Python scripting, `test_Day.txt` for freeform experimentation)
- Suggested edits and commit exercises
- Link to new practice files like `Branching.txt`, `MergeConflict.txt`, and `CommitHistory.md` once they’re added
