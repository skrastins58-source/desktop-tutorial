# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Git Issues

This document helps identify and resolve common Git workflow mistakes in the desktop-tutorial repository.

## Common Mistakes

### Accidental File Creation

**Problem:** Creating files with git command output by mistake
```bash
# Wrong - accidentally creates a file named "tatus"
git status > tatus

# Wrong - typo creates unwanted files  
git stauts > status.txt
```

**Solution:** Always double-check your commands
```bash
# Correct - view status without creating files
git status

# Correct - if you want to save status, use proper filename
git status > git_status.txt
```

### Pull Request Title Typos

**Problem:** PR titles like "Create tatus" instead of "Create status"

**Solution:** Always review:
1. Check title spelling before creating PR
2. Ensure title describes the actual changes
3. Use clear, descriptive language

### File Naming Issues

**Problem:** Files with special characters or unclear names

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive names: `status_report.md` not `tatus`
- Avoid special characters in filenames
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Prevention Tips

1. **Review before committing:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```

2. **Use descriptive commit messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add git status documentation to troubleshooting guide"
   ```

3. **Double-check file additions:**
   ```bash
   git add -p  # Interactive adding to review each change
   ```
