# Copilot Instructions for CI Workflows

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Downloads external dependencies before firewall restrictions
- Builds and tests the project across platforms
- Publishes artifacts and test results

## How to Extend It

- Add new steps using comments like `# Add code quality check here`
- Use Copilot to generate YAML for caching, deployment, or matrix builds
